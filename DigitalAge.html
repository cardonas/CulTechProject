										<h3>Effects on the human brain due to learning and playing a instrument.</h3>
										<h4>Brain Platicity</h4>
										<p>Brain placitiy is extemely import when learning to play an instrument or even a new song. When learning an instrument there is a need for constant repetition to make sure that your are playing the current notes.
											as well as reading the sheet music. Not only is there learning in your head what each not sounds like but also the muscle memory that has to be developed to preform fast sections of the music with ease. This gets not only 
											sections of the brain working in sync. Whilst performing music they have found that whole the brain is working instead of just one half. Music involves math and logic along with motor control of hands. That is where the
											left hemisphere which has control of mathematic, writting, analytics, and right hand movement. Creativity and imagination is found where every you find or even hear music. Even emotions play an major part in the musical that 
											our brains perform every time an insturment is played. This wouldn't be possible without the involvement of right hemisphere. The main control center of creativity, emotions, imagination, and left hand motions exist in this 
											part of the brain. Both halves of the brain and increased matter studies had found that mathematics and critical thinking are highly improved with music you. To find out more press <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2996135/">here</a> to read the study.

										<h4>Multitasking</h4>
										<p>Althought there isn't any thing such as a true multitasking. Musicians certain make it look liek there is there. The could be thought as the ultimate
											task switchers. From bouncing back and forth from looking at sheet music to looking at the conductor in some cases. All while trying to remember which 
											finger combinations are needed to play a not or how to play rhymthms correctly. The difference in the amount of time it tasks to switch tasks for musicians
											is approx. 150 milliseconds faster than non-musicians as found in a studies. You can read more <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2996135/">here</a>.

										<h3>Health</h3>
										<p>Along with all this benefits from cognative retention for children and teens. There is are many benefits for adults as well and even senior that are sign that
											no one should stop or give up playing instruments. As well, they are very compelling to reason to start playing an instrument.</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Longer life span</li>
											<li>Decrease in cognative decline such as dementia</li>
											<li>Helps to keep from mental issues at an older age</li>
											<li>Better menorization</li>
											<li>Decrease change of respiratory issues.</li>
										</ul>
